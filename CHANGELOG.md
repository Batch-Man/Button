# Project: Button - by Kvc
## v1.0
This version shows the Button layout and uses batbox to check, if the button
is clicked. So, the Printing of buttons and the mouse click - both are handled 
by Batbox by darkbatcher.


## v2.0
This version uses GetInput from Aacini to get the user input, as it allows for 
the mouse hover effect without complicated code. and batbox by darkbatcher is 
still used to quickly printout the button layouts at various console positions. 


## v3.0 aka 20231202
1. After the windows 7 era,Microsoft has enabled the quick credit mode by default
in all console windows. Version 3 has taken care of that.
2. One by one, printing of buttons fixed. All buttons will be printed at once.
3. Other minor Bugs Fixed.
